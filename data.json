Okay, let's break down this problem and craft a solid API design and error handling strategy. You're on the right track with the asynchronous processing.

API Design Considerations

HTTP Method: Yes, a POST request is appropriate for creating a new resource (the merged document) based on provided input.

API Name: Here are a few options for the API name, focusing on clarity and conciseness:

/merge-documents: This is straightforward and easy to understand.
/documents/merge: This emphasizes the action of merging documents.
/merged-documents: This focuses on the resource being created.
/documents/composite: If you want to suggest you are creating a composite document.
I'd recommend either /merge-documents or /documents/merge for their clear and direct meaning. I'll use /merge-documents in this explanation.

Request Body: Your request body structure is good. It's clear and allows for future expansion.

{
    "mergedDocumentName": "mergedDocumentDes",
    "documentNames": [
        "document_1",
        "document_2"
    ],
    "metaData": {}
}
Error Handling Strategy

You've correctly identified the key challenge: validating and merging documents can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Here's a strategy that balances responsiveness and robust error handling:

Immediate Response (Request Registration):

When the API receives a POST request to /merge-documents, your service should perform minimal validation immediately. This includes:

Validating the request body structure (e.g., mergedDocumentName is a string, documentNames is an array).
Possibly validating the existence of a name for the merged document
You can check if documentNames array is not empty, and elements inside are string
You may also do basic authentication and authorization checks here.
Crucially, do NOT download the documents from S3 at this stage.

Generate a unique identifier for the merge request (e.g., a UUID).

Store this request along with the unique id in a database/cache/ in memory for tracking purpose.

Push a message to your SQS queue containing the merge request data along with unique id

Immediately return a 202 Accepted HTTP status code to the client. The response body should include:

The unique identifier for the merge request.
A status endpoint URL, allowing the client to check the progress of the merge operation(This would be done by the request id).
Example of the response body:

{
  "requestId": "unique-request-id-here",
   "statusUrl": "/merge-documents/status/unique-request-id-here"
}
This gives the client immediate feedback that the request was accepted and is being processed without having to wait for all the processing to finish.

Asynchronous Processing (SQS Worker):

Your SQS worker (the application that receives messages from SQS) is responsible for the heavy lifting:
Retrieve Document Data: Use the information in the SQS message to retrieve the documents from S3 using the names provided.
Download documents one by one and perform validation and check if all the documents are downloaded successfully.
Validate Content: Validate that all of the documents exist and are accessible, and are the appropriate document type (you might want to have an allow list or deny list for document types.) Validate size constraints for the merged output.
Merge Documents: Perform the actual document merging operation.
Upload Merged Document: Upload the merged document to S3 with a unique name associated with the request ID.
Update Status: Update the status of the merge request in your database/cache/in memory using unique id. This will include setting:
Status: "PENDING", "PROCESSING", "SUCCESS", or "FAILED"
S3 url of the merged document (in case of success)
Error message (in case of failure)
You could also store metadata related to the processing
Status Endpoint:

Implement a GET API at /merge-documents/status/{requestId} which takes requestId as path paramter.
This API will query your data store for the request id and return the current status of the request, including:
The status of the operation ("PENDING", "PROCESSING", "SUCCESS", "FAILED").
If successful, provide the URL to the merged document in S3.
If failed, provide an error message explaining the reason for the failure.
Error Scenarios and Handling

Here are some specific error scenarios and how to handle them within this framework:

Invalid Request Body:
API immediately returns a 400 Bad Request with an appropriate error message.
Document Not Found:
SQS worker detects the missing document during S3 retrieval, updates status to "FAILED" with the error reason, and returns the status.
Invalid Document Type:
SQS worker detects invalid types, sets status to "FAILED," and provides an error message.
Merged Document Size Limit Exceeded:
SQS worker performs this check and updates the status to "FAILED," with an appropriate error message
S3 Errors (Permissions, etc.):
SQS worker detects these during retrieval or upload, and updates the status to "FAILED" with an appropriate error message.
Unexpected Errors:
SQS worker should catch exceptions and update the status to "FAILED" along with error details. Implement robust logging to capture these.
Benefits of this approach:

Responsiveness: The client doesn't have to wait long for an initial response, as processing happens asynchronously.
Scalability: Using SQS allows you to scale your processing workers independently of your API.
Resiliency: SQS helps manage failures by retrying messages, giving you a chance to recover from transient errors.
Clear Error Reporting: Status endpoint allows users to get accurate and clear information on the status of their merge operation and reasons for errors.

The sqs workers can go out of memory if there are lot of requests coming right for large documents sizes?

AI
You've raised a very important point. Yes, if your SQS workers are not designed to handle large documents and high throughput, they absolutely can run into out-of-memory errors (OOM), among other issues. Here's a breakdown of why and how to mitigate those risks:

Why Out-of-Memory Issues Occur with SQS Workers

Large Document Sizes:
Memory Consumption: When you download large documents from S3 into the memory of the SQS worker for processing, it can quickly consume available RAM. Especially, if these large documents are to be processed at once, the memory requirement increases dramatically.
Merge Processing: The merging process itself can be memory-intensive, especially if it involves complex operations, generating intermediate files or objects that need to reside in memory.
High Concurrency/Throughput:
Parallel Processing: If multiple SQS worker instances try to process many large documents concurrently, the combined memory usage can quickly exceed the available memory on the worker nodes.
Rapid Influx of Messages: A sudden surge of messages in SQS can lead to multiple workers trying to process large documents simultaneously, causing memory exhaustion.
Memory Leaks:
Application Bugs: Memory leaks in your merging or other document processing code, if any, can lead to OOM errors over time. Even if the documents are not large if the application is leaking memory, over a period of time the worker will run out of memory.
Strategies to Mitigate Memory Issues in SQS Workers

Streaming/Chunking:
Download in Chunks: Instead of downloading the entire document into memory at once, download it in smaller chunks using the S3 SDK's streaming capabilities. Process each chunk and discard it once it is processed.
Streaming Merge: Use a streaming approach for merging documents as much as possible. For example, instead of loading entire PDFs into memory, merge them page by page, or stream bytes from different files and write to output.
Bounded Memory Use:
Set Max Heap Size: Properly configure JVM (if it's Java app) memory settings for the SQS worker instance. Setting the Xmx option limits how much memory JVM can allocate.
Implement Caching: Use caching strategies if appropriate. For example, if document metadata needs to be reused frequently cache it at worker end to avoid repeatedly making call to databases or other services.
Vertical and Horizontal Scaling:
Vertical Scaling: Increase the RAM and processing power of your worker instances, if this approach is within budget, and this addresses most of the problems.
Horizontal Scaling: Ensure that you have enough worker instances running so that large document merge requests are distributed across multiple instances.
Worker Instance Monitoring and Auto Scaling:
Resource Monitoring: Closely monitor the CPU, memory utilization, and other resources on your worker instances.
Auto-Scaling Policies: Implement auto-scaling policies that dynamically adjust the number of worker instances based on SQS queue length, CPU/memory utilization and custom metrics.
Batch Processing/Message Grouping:
Group Similar Documents: If certain document merging processes consume similar resources, group them to be processed on same worker instance instead of being distributed randomly.
Batch Processing: Instead of each worker getting individual messages from the queue, implement batching logic where a single worker takes a batch of messages and processes them together.
Optimize Your Merging Algorithm:
Efficient Algorithms: Ensure that the merging algorithm you are using is efficient and does not consume excessive resources.
Code Reviews and Profiling:
Memory Leak Prevention: Make sure you have rigorous code reviews and memory profiling to catch and fix potential memory leaks in your code.
Dead Letter Queue (DLQ):
Message Handling: Configure a dead-letter queue for SQS to handle messages that fail multiple times. These messages can be investigated separately.
Rate Limiting:
Limit Concurrency: Implement rate limiting mechanisms to control the number of concurrent document merging requests being processed on a single instance of the worker.
Applying These to Your Scenario

Prioritize Streaming: The most important strategy for handling large documents will be using streaming and chunking approaches. Avoid holding large objects in memory.
Scaling: Implement auto scaling and resource monitoring to keep your worker instance within limits.
Memory Profiling: Use memory profiling tools (e.g., Java VisualVM, JProfiler if you are using Java) during development to identify and eliminate memory leaks.
Batch Processing: If there are no dependencies between document merging requests from the same user, implementing batching will reduce the overhead of repeatedly making calls to database and other services and also the number of SQS messages processed.
Example (Java using S3 SDK)

import com.amazonaws.services.s3.AmazonS3;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.S3Object;
import com.amazonaws.services.s3.model.S3ObjectInputStream;
import java.io.ByteArrayOutputStream;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStream;


public class DocumentMerger {

    private final AmazonS3 s3Client;
    private static final int CHUNK_SIZE = 8192;

    public DocumentMerger(AmazonS3 s3Client){
        this.s3Client=s3Client;
    }


    public void mergeAndUpload(String s3BucketName, String[] docNames, String destinationDocName) throws IOException {

        try (ByteArrayOutputStream mergedStream = new ByteArrayOutputStream()){
            for (String docName: docNames){
                S3Object s3Object = s3Client.getObject(s3BucketName, docName);
                try(S3ObjectInputStream inputStream = s3Object.getObjectContent()){
                    copyStream(inputStream,mergedStream);
                }

            }
            //Upload to s3
           s3Client.putObject(s3BucketName, destinationDocName, mergedStream.toByteArray());
        }



    }

    private void copyStream(InputStream inputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream outputStream) throws IOException {

        byte[] buffer = new byte[CHUNK_SIZE];
        int bytesRead;

        while ((bytesRead = inputStream.read(buffer)) != -1) {
            outputStream.write(buffer, 0, bytesRead);
        }
    }
}

Key Takeaway

You are right to be concerned about OOM errors. It's crucial to design your SQS worker application to handle document processing efficiently and to scale horizontally with sufficient resources to handle the load. By being proactive with memory management, streaming, and scalable architecture, you can prevent these problems and ensure the reliability of your document merging service.

Can i configure sqs with number of messages being processed , like at a time I dont't want my worker to process more than 5 messages

AI
Yes, you absolutely can configure SQS to limit the number of messages that your worker processes concurrently. This is a crucial technique for controlling resource usage and preventing your workers from being overwhelmed. Here are the primary ways to achieve this with SQS:

1. Max Number of Messages (Receive Message Configuration)

What it Does: When a worker calls the receiveMessage API (or its SDK equivalent), it can specify the MaxNumberOfMessages parameter. This parameter sets the maximum number of messages the SQS service will attempt to deliver in a single API call.

How to Use: Your SQS worker's code needs to be modified to include the MaxNumberOfMessages parameter when it pulls messages from the queue. In Java using the AWS SDK, it looks like this:

import com.amazonaws.services.sqs.AmazonSQS;
import com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.ReceiveMessageRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.ReceiveMessageResult;
import com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.Message;

import java.util.List;


public class SQSMessageProcessor {

    private AmazonSQS sqsClient;
    private static final int MAX_MESSAGES_TO_PROCESS = 5;

    public SQSMessageProcessor(AmazonSQS sqsClient){
        this.sqsClient=sqsClient;
    }

   public  void processMessages(String queueUrl){
       ReceiveMessageRequest receiveMessageRequest = new ReceiveMessageRequest(queueUrl)
               .withMaxNumberOfMessages(MAX_MESSAGES_TO_PROCESS);

       ReceiveMessageResult receiveMessageResult = sqsClient.receiveMessage(receiveMessageRequest);
       List<Message> messages = receiveMessageResult.getMessages();

       for (Message message : messages) {
         // process the message
         System.out.println("message = "+ message);
         // after you process the message then delete it
         sqsClient.deleteMessage(queueUrl,message.getReceiptHandle());
       }

   }
}
Key Point: This setting limits how many messages a single worker instance receives in a single pull. It does not globally limit how many messages are processed across all workers.

2. Concurrency Control within your Worker Application

What it Does: You need additional logic in your worker application to limit concurrency even after you've received a batch of messages.
How to Use:
Thread Pools/Executors: Use thread pools to manage the execution of tasks (processing a message). Configure the pool to have a limited number of threads (e.g., 5). When you receive messages, add tasks to the thread pool, but if all the threads are busy the tasks would be queued and wait to be executed.
Semaphores/Locks: Use synchronization primitives to allow only a limited number of concurrent processes at any given time.
Example (Java with Thread Pool)
import com.amazonaws.services.sqs.AmazonSQS;
import com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.ReceiveMessageRequest;
import com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.ReceiveMessageResult;
import com.amazonaws.services.sqs.model.Message;

import java.util.List;
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;


public class SQSMessageProcessor {

    private AmazonSQS sqsClient;
    private static final int MAX_MESSAGES_TO_PROCESS = 5;
    private static final int MAX_CONCURRENT_THREADS = 5;
    private ExecutorService executorService;

    public SQSMessageProcessor(AmazonSQS sqsClient){
        this.sqsClient=sqsClient;
        this.executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(MAX_CONCURRENT_THREADS);

    }

   public  void processMessages(String queueUrl){
       ReceiveMessageRequest receiveMessageRequest = new ReceiveMessageRequest(queueUrl)
               .withMaxNumberOfMessages(MAX_MESSAGES_TO_PROCESS);

       ReceiveMessageResult receiveMessageResult = sqsClient.receiveMessage(receiveMessageRequest);
       List<Message> messages = receiveMessageResult.getMessages();

       for (Message message : messages) {
            executorService.submit(()-> processSingleMessage(queueUrl,message));
       }

   }

    private void processSingleMessage(String queueUrl,Message message){
        System.out.println("message = "+ message);
        // after you process the message then delete it
        sqsClient.deleteMessage(queueUrl,message.getReceiptHandle());
    }
}
Key Point: This gives you fine-grained control over how many messages are actively being processed within a single worker.
3. Combining Both

The best practice is typically to use both the MaxNumberOfMessages setting and implement concurrency control within your worker application.

MaxNumberOfMessages limits the batch size you retrieve at once, preventing your worker from attempting to pull a massive number of messages.
Internal concurrency controls (like thread pools) then ensure that the processing of the batch of messages happens with a set number of threads, and thus prevents OOM situations and resource exhaustion.
Additional Considerations

Visibility Timeout: SQS has a "visibility timeout" setting, which determines how long a message remains invisible after being received by a worker. If the message isn't deleted within that time, it becomes visible again and can be delivered to another worker. Make sure the visibility timeout is set appropriately for the processing time of your document merges.
Pre-Fetching: If your worker has a higher throughput for processing messages than SQS can provide, consider pre-fetching messages (e.g. keep retrieving more messages while messages are being processed).
Auto Scaling: If you have the potential to process more messages than your worker instances can handle, the best approach to scale is with auto scaling of your worker instances.
In summary:

Set MaxNumberOfMessages in your receiveMessage calls to control how many messages each worker pulls from the queue at once.

Implement internal concurrency control using mechanisms like thread pools, semaphores, etc., to manage how many messages are actively being processed within each worker.

Combine them with visibility timeout and other scaling options.

By using these strategies, you can create a more resilient and resource-aware system for processing messages from your SQS queue, especially when you're dealing with potentially large documents and high traffic.

UML Diagram (Class Diagram)

Here's a class diagram outlining the key components of your system. I'll focus on the core components and their relationships.

Explanation of the UML Diagram:

DocumentMergeService: This class represents your API layer and is responsible for receiving requests, triggering the merging process, retrieving the status of the merge, and streaming the merged document.
MergeRequest: The data object representing client request to merge documents
MergeResponse: The data object representing the response to the client after accepting a merge request
MergeStatus: The data object representing the status of the merge request
SQSMessageProducer: This class sends messages to the SQS queue. It is called from the DocumentMergeService.
SQSMessageConsumer: This represents the service that listens to the SQS queue and processes merge requests asynchronously.
DocumentProcessor: The core logic of the worker that downloads the document from S3, merges it and uploads back to S3
S3Client: A wrapper class for interacting with S3. It handles downloading individual documents, streaming downloads and uploading the merged document.
DocumentStatusDatabase: This class represents the database used to store merge request statuses.
MultipartFile Represents a streamed multipart file.
InputStream: Represents an input stream, use for both s3 downloads as well as providing stream response to the client for merged document
Relationships: The arrows represent the relationships between components. For example, DocumentMergeService uses SQSMessageProducer to send a message to SQS.
Key Points in the Design:

Asynchronous Processing: The core logic of the document merge operation happens asynchronously, thanks to the SQS queue. This design ensures the web application remains responsive and scalable, thus, avoiding long wait times for the user.
Clear Separation of Concerns: The classes are designed with distinct responsibilities, which makes the design easier to understand and maintain.
Streaming: The merged documents are streamed as a multipart file, making it easy for the client to download large merged files.
Next Steps

Implementation: Now, you can use these OpenAPI definitions and the UML diagram to guide the implementation in your Java Spring application.
Testing: You must perform robust testing of each endpoint, with considerations for large documents, load, failures etc.
Monitoring: Remember to set up monitoring for both the application and SQS to ensure that the system is performing as intended.
This detailed response should give you a solid base to begin your implementation. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!

You can use a few websites to render the PlantUML code into a diagram. Here are some popular and reliable options:

1. PlantText:

URL: https://www.planttext.com/
How it Works: PlantText is a dedicated website for rendering PlantUML diagrams. It's very straightforward to use.
Go to the PlantText website.
Paste your PlantUML code (the one I provided) into the left-hand text area.
Click the "Submit" button.
The rendered diagram will appear on the right-hand side.
You can also export it as an image (PNG, SVG, etc.).
Pros:
Simple and easy to use.
Renders most PlantUML diagrams correctly.
No registration required.
Supports image export.
Cons:
Basic interface with limited editing capabilities.
2. PlantUML Online Server:

URL: https://www.plantuml.com/plantuml/uml/
How it Works: This is the official online server provided by the creators of PlantUML.
Go to the provided URL.
Paste your PlantUML code in the text area.
Click the "submit" button.
Diagram would appear below the text area.
Download image or text options would be available too.
Pros:
Official server for PlantUML.
Good for rendering many types of PlantUML diagrams
Cons:
Limited editing capabilities
3. GitHub (With Markdown Files):

How it Works: If you have your PlantUML code in a .puml file, or embedded in markdown file, GitHub can render it directly in your repository.
Create a file with a .puml extension or use markdown (.md) file and embed plantuml diagrams inside.
Check in the files to github, github automatically renders the image inside your repository.
Pros:
Good for version control.
Easy to share with team members.
Integrated in github
Cons:
Not very useful for quick testing of diagrams.
4. Visual Studio Code Extensions:

How it Works: If you use VS Code, there are excellent PlantUML extensions that let you preview and render diagrams within the IDE.
Install the "PlantUML" extension (or similar).
Open or create a .puml file.
Type in your code.
Preview the rendered diagram.
Pros:
Seamless integration within the VS Code environment.
Preview and edit options.
Good for large projects.
Cons:
Requires VS Code installation.
You need to be familiar with the extension setup.
5. Online UML Editors with PlantUML Support:

Some Online Editors: Websites like draw.io or diagrams.net (now rebranded) support PlantUML input.
Go to your preferred diagram editor's website.
Find a way to input or import PlantUML code (often under 'Import' or similar options).
Paste your code and preview.
Pros:
Often have more extensive drawing and editing features.
Cons:
Might have slightly different rendering or may not fully support all PlantUML features.
Recommendation:

For your immediate purpose of visualizing the diagram, I recommend using PlantText or the PlantUML Online Server. They are quick, easy to use, and don't require any setup or registration. Just paste the code and see the result.

If you are working on a project with multiple diagrams or intend to edit your diagram frequently, you might want to consider using a VS Code extension or GitHub.

Feel free to try out any of these options. If you encounter any issues with rendering, please let me know!
